# -Field::newton_raphson currently does not use Hessian information, because the Hessian can be indefinite. Use an implementation of modified Cholesky to allow use of Hessian.
# -Field::dbetabinom/score/derivatives rely on differences b/w log gamma functions that can suffer catastrophic cancellation, or otherwise crap out. This seems to happen when the concentration parameter gets large. Could use stable, mesh-based algorithm for these computations?
# -Field should allow concentrations to get fixed to Inf and then return binomial likelihood.
# -Field could allow the locus-specific means to be part of the laplace approximation, instead of analytically integrating them out. This might improve stability (but not sure)
#
# -Problem::optimize should allow fixed field that gives the parameter values that are allowed to vary. If none are allowed to vary, it should just return the likelihood. This gives a unified interface.
#
# -ResistanceOptim should be templated to allow choice of link
# -ResistanceOptim::optimize should allow fixed field that is passed to Problem::optimize, and should also allow startng values that are passed to Problem::optimize. This will unify the interface.
#
# -ResistanceSolver links should be templated to allow parameters where necessary
# -ResistanceSolver R api has a bunch of wrappers for link functions. Better to consolidate into a single wrapper with a switch.
# -ResistanceSolver add inverse logit link ::: DONE 20 Sep 2018
